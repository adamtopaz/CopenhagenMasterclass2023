# Formalizing Condensed Mathematics

This is the central repository for the [2023 masterclass](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/calendar/events/formalisation-of-mathematics/) on the formalization of condensed mathematics, taking place in 2023 at Copehnagen.

## Installation

### Local installation

This is the best way; you can edit files and experiment, and you won't lose them.
It's also the hardest way: it involves typing stuff in on the command line. 

In brief: first install Lean 4 following the instructions [here](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

Then download and install this project by typing

```
git clone git@github.com:adamtopaz/CopenhagenMasterclass2023
cd CopenhagenMasterclass2023
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

Finally, open the root directory of the project folder in VS Code (for example by typing `code .`, or by opening VS Code and then clicking `File -> Open Folder` and opening the `CopenhagenMasterclass2023` folder). You can now open the Lean files in the
repository and Lean should run on them automatically.
