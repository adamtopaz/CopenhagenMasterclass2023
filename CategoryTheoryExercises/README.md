# Category theory exercises

These are the category theory exercises from the 2020 conference "Lean for the
curious mathematician", written by Scott Morrison in Lean 3 and ported to Lean 4
by me (Kevin Buzzard). I thought they might be good practice for people wanting
to get the hang of category theory in Lean, although they probably go far further
into some parts of the theory than we need. 

Note: Others could have ported these exercises. Right now some of the
hints no longer exist, others might be misleading. I have only solved half of the
exercises so can't guarantee that I ported them all correctly.

Exercises are in the Exercises directory; solutions are in the Solutions directory.
