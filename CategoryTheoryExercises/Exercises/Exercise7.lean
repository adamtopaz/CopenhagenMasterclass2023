Let's define the category of monoid objects in a monoidal category.

open CategoryTheory

universe u

variables (C : Type u) [Category C] [MonoidalCategory C]

open MonoidalCategory

structure Mon_ :=
(X : C)
(ι : 𝟙_ C ⟶ X)
(μ : X ⊗ X ⟶ X)
-- There are three missing axioms here!
-- Use `λ_ X`, `ρ_ X` and `α_ X Y Z` for unitors and associators.


namespace Mon_

variables {C}

@[ext]
structure hom (M N : Mon_ C) :=
(hom : M.X ⟶ N.X)
-- What are the axioms?




instance : Category (Mon_ C) :=
sorry

end Mon_

(Note: since LFTCM2020, the goal of this exercise has been PR'd to mathlib,
under `category_theory.monoidal.internal`, along with several of the projects listed below.)
Bonus projects (all but the first will be non-trivial with today's mathlib):
* ✓ Construct the category of module objects for a fixed monoid object.
* ✓ Check that `Mon_ Type ≌ Mon`.
* Check that `Mon_ Mon ≌ CommMon`, via the Eckmann-Hilton argument.
  (You'll have to hook up the cartesian monoidal structure on `Mon` first.)
* Check that `Mon_ AddCommGroup ≌ Ring`.
  (You'll have to hook up the monoidal structure on `AddCommGroup`.
  Currently we have the monoidal structure on `Module R`; perhaps one could specialize to `R = ℤ`
  and transport the monoidal structure across an equivalence? This sounds like some work!)
* ✓ Check that `Mon_ (Module R) ≌ Algebra R`.
* Show that if `C` is braided (you'll have to define that first!)
   then `Mon_ C` is naturally monoidal.
* Can you transport this monoidal structure to `Ring` or `Algebra R`?
  How does it compare to the "native" one?
