# Sheaves on CompHaus are equivalent to sheaves on ExtrDisc

The forgetful functor from extremally disconnected spaces `ExtrDisc` to compact
Hausdorff spaces `CompHaus` has the marvellous property that it induces an equivalence of categories
between sheaves on these two sites. With the terminology of nLab, `ExtrDisc` is a
*dense subsite* of `CompHaus`: see https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dense+sub-site

Mathlib has isolated three properties called `CoverDense`, `CoverPreserving` and `CoverLifting`,
which between them imply that `ExtrDisc` is a dense subsite, and it also has the
construction of the equivalence of the categories of sheaves, given these three properties.

## Main theorems

* `Condensed.coverDense`, `Condensed.coverPreserving`, `Condensed.coverLifting`: the
three conditions needed to guarantee the equivalence of the categories of sheaves
on the two sites.

## TODO

Prove the three main theorems!
